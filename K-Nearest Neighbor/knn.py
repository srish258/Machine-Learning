        In this function, features is simply training data which is a 2D list with float values.

        Student 2 with features age 22, grade 3.0 and labeled as 1, then the feature data would be
        [ [25.0, 3.8], [22.0,3.0] ] and the corresponding label would be [0,1]
        For KNN, the training process is just loading of training data. Thus, all you need to do in this function
        is create some local variable in KNN class to store this data so you can use the data in later process.
